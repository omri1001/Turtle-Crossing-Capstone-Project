# Turtle-Crossing-Capstone-Project
This Python project is a classic arcade-style game called "Turtle Crossing." The goal of the game is to help the turtle cross a busy highway by avoiding oncoming cars.

The game is built using the Turtle graphics library and consists of several classes that work together to create the game. The Player class represents the turtle that the player controls. The CarManager class creates and manages the cars that appear on the screen. The Scoreboard class keeps track of the player's score and level.

The game starts with a blank screen, and the player can move the turtle up by pressing the Up arrow key. The CarManager class creates cars that move horizontally across the screen from right to left. If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over, and the player loses. If the turtle successfully crosses the highway, the level increases, and the game becomes more difficult with faster cars.

The Scoreboard class displays the player's current level and score, and when the player loses, the game over screen is displayed. The game loop continues until the player loses or decides to exit the game.

Overall, this is a fun and challenging game that is suitable for all ages and is a great example of how to build a simple arcade-style game using Python and the Turtle graphics library.
